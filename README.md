# Models<br>

Multinomial Naive Bayes: <br>
Used for Sentiment Analysis where: <br>
Positive sentiment detection: 45 / 51 <br>
Negative sentiment detection: 19 / 50 <br>
Neutral sentiment detection: 13 / 30 <br>

So the model is great at detecting Positive sentiment but not so great at detecting the rest. Posible cause could be the dataset since it contains only about 500 rows.


Linear Regression and Decision Tree Classifier: <br>
For this code I used a wine quality dataset<br>
Used Linear Regression to predict the PH levels <br>
Used DTC to predict the quality <br>

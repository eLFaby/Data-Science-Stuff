Multinomial Naive Bayes: <br>
Used for Sentiment Analysis where: <br>
Positive sentiment detection: 45 / 51 <br>
Negative sentiment detection: 19 / 50 <br>
Neutral sentiment detection: 13 / 30 <br>

So the model is great at detecting Positive sentiment but not so great at detecting the rest. Posible cause could be the dataset since it contains only about 500 rows.
